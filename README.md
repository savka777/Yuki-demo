## Vision

Yuki is building **the Notion of study apps** - a unified knowledge interface where users can design their own AI-powered learning workflows. Instead of rigid, one-size-fits-all study tools, Yuki empowers learners to create personalized systems that adapt to their unique learning patterns.

## Key Results

- **85% better retention** through optimized spaced repetition
- **3x faster learning** with AI-generated content
- **Active users** experiencing measurable improvement in study outcomes
- **Zero-downtime** production deployment with 20+ releases

## Core Features


### Smart Repetition
Advanced algorithms powered by the SM-2 spaced repetition method, enhanced with machine learning to show you cards exactly when you need to review them for optimal long-term retention.

### AI Generation
Upload any document (PDF, text, slides) and get high-quality flashcards generated automatically using advanced AI. Supports:
- Code formatting for programming concepts
- Mathematical expressions and equations
- Context-aware question generation
- Customizable AI system instructions

### Focused Sessions
Distraction-free study sessions that adapt to your pace and learning style:
- Real-time difficulty adjustment
- Performance tracking and analytics
- Customizable session lengths
- Progress visualization


## Coming Soon

### Exam Analysis
Upload past papers to identify patterns and predict question types with AI analysis. Understand what topics are most likely to appear and focus your studying accordingly.

### ML-Powered Analytics
Track your learning patterns with intelligent insights:
- Response time analysis
- Retention rate optimization
- Learning pattern detection
- Personalized study recommendations

### Practice Tests
AI-generated practice exams that simulate real test conditions and difficulty levels. Get realistic preparation for your actual assessments.

### Smart Notes
Transform lectures and documents into structured, searchable study notes with automatic summarization and key concept extraction.

### Advanced Integrations
Connect with popular note-taking tools like Obsidian, Notion, and Anki for seamless workflow integration.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern UI design

### AI & ML Pipeline
- **OpenAI API** integration for content generation
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for intelligent content processing
- **Vector databases** for semantic search and content retrieval
- **Custom ML models** for learning pattern analysis

### Backend & Database
- **Prisma ORM** with PostgreSQL for robust data management
- **Vector embeddings** for semantic content search

### Deployment
- **Vercel** for seamless deployment and scaling
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **Monitoring** with error tracking and performance analytics

## Advanced Algorithms

### Spaced Repetition Enhancement
Building on the proven SM-2 algorithm with modern ML improvements:
- **Personalized difficulty scaling** based on individual performance
- **Context-aware scheduling** considering study patterns and preferences
- **Forgetting curve optimization** using historical data

### Content Generation
- **Dynamic prompt engineering** for context-appropriate flashcard creation
- **Multi-modal content support** (text, code, math,)
- **Quality scoring** to ensure generated content meets learning standards

## Design Philosophy

Yuki is designed around the principle of **customizable intelligence**. Rather than forcing users into predetermined study methods, we want to provide:

- **Flexible AI workflows** that users can design and modify
- **Adaptive algorithms** that learn from individual usage patterns
- **Modular features** that can be combined in unique ways
- **Open architecture** for future extensibility

## Development Status

**Current Phase:** Core Platform Development
- ✅ Basic spaced repetition system
- ✅ AI-powered flashcard generation
- ✅ User authentication and data management
- ✅ Performance analytics dashboard
- In Progress: RAG implementation
- In Progress: ML-powered personalization
- Planned: Exam analysis engine
- Planned: Practice test generation

## Target Users

- **University students** preparing for exams and coursework
- **Professional learners** acquiring new technical skills
- **Language learners** building vocabulary and comprehension
- **Anyone** looking to optimize their learning and retention

## What Makes Yuki Different

Unlike traditional flashcard apps, Yuki is building a **platform approach**:

1. **Customizable AI Workflows** - Users design their own learning systems
2. **Cross-Domain Application** - Same core technology works for any subject
3. **Research-Backed** - Built on proven cognitive science principles
4. **Production-Ready** - Designed for scale and reliability from day one

## Roadmap

### Short Term (3 months)
- Complete RAG system implementation
- Launch ML analytics dashboard
- Beta testing with 100+ users
- Mobile-responsive design improvements

### Medium Term (6 months)
- Exam analysis feature launch
- Practice test generation
- Advanced collaboration features
- API for third-party integrations

### Long Term (12 months)
- Smart notes system
- Enterprise education partnerships
- Advanced AI personalization
- Platform extensibility for developers
